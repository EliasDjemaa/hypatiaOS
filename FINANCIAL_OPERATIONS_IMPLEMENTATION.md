# Financial & Contract Lifecycle Management (FCLM) Implementation

## üéØ Overview

We have successfully extended hypatiaOS from a Clinical Trial Operating System into a **complete Clinical Research Business Platform** by implementing a comprehensive Financial & Contract Lifecycle Management (FCLM) layer. This transforms the platform from handling just clinical operations to managing the entire contract-to-payment workflow.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Enhancement

### New Microservices Added

#### 1. Contract Service (`contract-service`)

- **Port**: 3005
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (financial tables) + S3 (document storage)
- **Key Features**:
  - Contract creation, negotiation, and execution
  - AI-powered risk analysis of contract clauses
  - E-signature integration (DocuSign/Adobe Sign)
  - Version control and amendment tracking
  - Automated contract renewal management

#### 2. Budget Service (integrated into Contract Service)
**Purpose**: Manages study and site-level budgets with milestone-based payments
- **Key Features**:
  - Budget templates and cost estimation
  - Milestone-triggered payment schedules
  - Real-time budget utilization tracking
  - AI-powered cost forecasting
  - Budget copying and adjustment tools

#### 3. Invoice Service (planned)
**Purpose**: Automated invoice generation based on completed milestones
- **Key Features**:

2. **`contract_clauses`** - Individual clauses with AI risk analysis
3. **`budgets`** - Study and site-level budgets
4. **`budget_line_items`** - Detailed budget components with milestone triggers
5. **`invoices`** - Generated invoices based on milestones
6. **`payments`** - Payment tracking and reconciliation
7. **`milestone_events`** - Operational events that trigger financial actions
8. **`financial_audit_logs`** - Comprehensive audit trail for compliance

#### Key Relationships
- **Contracts** ‚Üî **Studies/Sites** (1:many)
- **Budgets** ‚Üî **Contracts** (many:1)
- **Budget Line Items** ‚Üî **Milestone Events** (trigger-based)
- **Invoices** ‚Üî **Budget Line Items** (1:1 or 1:many)
